Description: Reading and post-processing radiative flux measurements in
	NetCDF format. Longwave balance can be converted to downward and
	data can be plotted. Other file formats (e.g. ASCII files
	containing Bioforsk data) are also supported along with basic
	irradiance and radiance calculations needed to prototype radiative
	flux estimates using satellite remote sensing.
